# ASSIGNMENT 1 - MOCKUP DESIGN

### Here is what you will need to complete the assignment:

1.  Create a Github account and repo.

2.  Learn about how to create a repository and set it up such that you
    can host and view your finished web pages on GitHub Pages, i.e.,
    GitHub.io domain name.

3.  Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container
    folder for your solution to this assignment. You will name it like
    this. For example, `rollNumber_assg_1`. Create an `index.html` file
    inside the solution container folder, e.g.,
    `rollNumber_assg_1/index.html`.

4.  The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow
    the mockup illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups:
    desktop, tablet, and mobile. Your implementation has to be JUST 1
    page, NOT 3 pages. In other words, you will be creating a single,
    responsive page.

5.  Your page must include a CSS file. No inline styles allowed. Your
    CSS file should be placed into a `css` folder under the solution
    container folder, e.g., `rollNumber_assg_1/css`.

6.  You are NOT allowed to use any CSS (or Javascript) framework for
    this assignment, including Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework. No
    framework CSS files should even be referenced in your index.html,
    even if you are not using them. **However, you MAY use the simple
    responsive framework we developed in class as a starting point for
    this assignment.**

7.  You must implement the following breakpoints that will be considered
    desktop, tablet, and mobile. The browser should display a desktop
    version of the site when the width of the browser window is 992px
    and above. Tablet view should appear only if the width of the
    browser window is between 768px and 991px, inclusively. Mobile view
    should appear only if the width of the browser is equal to or less
    than 767px.

8.  Your site is very simple. It consists of a page heading and 3
    sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains
    some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't
    matter. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the
    width of the browser window. (*Hint: use media queries discussed in
    class.*)

9.  Layout: In the desktop view (992px and above), each of the 3
    sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. As you
    make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should
    become wider or narrower. (\_Hint: use percentages to define width
    and use the 'float' property.). For a visual reference of this view,
    see the desktop mockup illustration below.

10. Layout: In the tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively),
    the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal
    size. The 3rd section should be in the second row and take up the
    entire row by itself. For a visual reference of this view, see the
    tablet mockup illustration below.

11. Layout: In the mobile view (equal to or less than 767px), each
    section should take up the entire row. For a visual reference of
    this view, see the mobile mockup illustration below.

12. Section title region: Each section should have a section title
    region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the
    section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the
    titles from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or
    come up with your own. (*Hint: use relative and absolute positioning
    and offsets.*)

13. Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup
    illustrations. Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal
    and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the
    section and the edges of the browser window. Also, note the spacing
    between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section.
    Lastly, make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it
    doesn't overlap the section title region. (\_Hint: use margins and
    padding and use border-box as your box-sizing.)

14. Borders and Colors: Each section should have a background color set
    to some color (of your choosing). Set the background color of each
    section title region to some unique color (of your choosing). Make
    sure that the background color still allows the user to view the
    text in the section and section title regions. Depending on the
    color you choose, you may want to change the color of the text so it
    can be easy to read. Set a black border on both the section and
    section title region that is 1px thick.

15. Explicitly set a font-family for the text in your page, so you are
    not stuck with the default browser font family. Also, set the font
    size of the heading and section title to be 75% larger and 25%
    larger (respectively) than the font size of the dummy text.

## Here is the mockup illustration of the desktop version of the site. 
Your final result should look very close to this mockup.

## Here is the mockup illustration of the tablet version of the site. 
Your final result should look very close to this mockup. Note that in this
view, the 3rd section takes up the entire row.

## Here is the mockup illustration of the mobile version of the site. 
Yourfinal result should look very close to this mockup.
